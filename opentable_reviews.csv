0,The calamari dish was Luke warm despite the cold sauce being placed on the side. Overall flavor was nice though. The theme of lukewarm food continued with the bbq chicken pizza. Not sure if the kitchen is moving faster than the waiter but food should be hot at a minimum. The passion fruit cocktail was great but the ginger beer cocktail was not as balanced as I would have expected. The ambiance is great. Sitting outside was nice snd the vibe makes you want to stay a while. Inadvertently stayed a while when our waiter disappeared for about 15 minutes after we finished eating and had to flag him down to get the check. Hotter for and more attentive staff would make this a 5/5.,2021-03-10,3,3,3,5
1,"Great staff, very accommodating. At one point we so conflicted about what wine to purchase... the staff were nice enough to provide a mini tasting of various wine options. Now that’s hospitality!!!",2021-02-27,5,5,5,5
2,"Ambiance was great, trendy yet retro. Cute spot for date night or getting some computer work done. Low lighting gives the space a soft and mellow feel.",2021-02-22,5,5,5,5
3,"Food was average. The menu read a lot more ""interesting"" than it tasted, however the food itself was tasty enough. Service was strange. We were served by 2 servers. The server who took our order seemed as if he could care less and could barely give us the time of day. However, later another server came to check on our food and finished the rest of our brunch service for us; she was lovely. The coffee tasted terrible. The environment was very pleasant.",2021-02-21,3,3,3,4

7,"We waited 55 minutes for the first course to come out - and the rest of service was incredibly slow as well :( Had high expectations, but the service was very poor. A couple next to us left after first course as it took so long.",2021-01-29,1,3,1,1

11,A fine hotel restaurant with an interesting menu of well prepared elments.  A warm hipster atmosphere - just like the rest of the hotel.The team does a very good job of handling pandemic restrictions.  A standout was the calamari with lemon.,2020-10-23,4,4,4,4

17,"My group & I dined at American Son 3 times during our stay at Eaton for the March on Washington. We had dinner twice, brunch once & the pre-made box lunches prepared for the March. We must have ordered all the dishes on the menu! Although some dishes weren’t to my personal preference, all were consistently delicious with excellent presentation, fresh ingredients and flavor profiles well balanced. The staff was always friendly, attentive & accommodating. As far as CoVid precautions, the restaurant & staff are taking & upholding all the safety protocols to the highest degree. The ambiance & design of the restaurant is superbly curated and beautiful without compromising comfort. If you’re traveling to DC or a local, I can’t recommend this place more. You won’t be disappointed!",2020-08-29,5,4,5,5
18,The biggest issue here was that there is absolutely no signage on the outside of the building or the inside of the building to see what the name of this place is. Inside is sparse and the menu is very limited. I wouldn’t go back here.,2020-08-29,3,4,4,2
19,The restaurant week brunch wasn’t really worth it..I wanted to like the place but the chocolate croissant was a bit raw the chicken sandwich was over brined and not very appetizing,2020-08-23,3,2,4,4
20,"American Son is definitely on my revisit list. The restaurant is inside a Hotel and there is very little signage, so be careful not to pass it. Great decor, cozy and the cocktails are simple but tasty, ALL the pastries are excellent, but the Duck Confit Hash was a tad salty and the French Toast a tad sweet. Minus sitting inside and constantly being bothered by flying insects I have no issues, the staff was friendly and constantly checking to make sure Our needs were met.",2020-08-23,4,4,5,4
21,Love the place it was beautiful. The food wasn’t worth the price in my opinion both quality and quantity haha. But the staff was great and the atmosphere was great. I’d give it another try for dinner or something. (I went for breakfast/brunch),2020-08-23,4,3,5,5
22,Great Restaurant Week Brunch menu.  Lots of choices.  Recommend Avocado Toast and Ricotta and Lemon Pancakes.,2020-08-22,5,5,5,5

24,Slow service. Uninterested server. Food ok.,2020-03-03,3,3,2,3
25,"On the day we went, they were booked for a private event an 1.25h after our reservation, so the restaurant was pretty empty and the service was a bit rushed. That being said they had amazing food— Benedict and burgers were amazing and good drinks as well. The place was nicely designed— would definitely go back just not when they had an event.",2020-02-29,4,5,3,5
26,The food was overpriced for the quality and quantity,2020-02-28,3,2,4,4

30,I have been here 3 times and the service is consistently slow. The server tonight was unattentive and I had to flag him down every time we were in need of service. Will not be coming here again.,2020-02-22,2,4,1,4
31,My friend and I both thought our meals (scallops; crab potato gnocchi) were lacking in flavor and the wrong temperature. This was a recommended restaurant from a colleague but missed the mark.,2020-02-21,2,1,3,2
32,Went for dinner. Food was fine. Prices are high.,2020-02-17,3,3,3,3
33,The tables were too small to hold all of our food. The plates were too small to share the food. The tables were too close to one another when there was plenty of space. The food was very good. The Brussel sprouts were a generous portion and very good.,2020-02-16,3,5,2,3
34,Hostess was friendly and welcoming. The manager was nice enough to check on us as well as other tables just see how we were enjoying everything. Flick was great super knowledgeable and made great drinks. The food was amazing the rabbit rigatoni and scallops were exceptional and cooked perfectly. The winter green salad was yummy. The desserts I could go for the pan cotta right now! Can’t wait to go back and try brunch.,2020-02-16,5,5,5,5

37,Great Valentines Dinner!,2020-02-14,5,5,5,5
38,Valentine’s Day meal with my significant other. The drinks and service were amazing. The food was good - highlight was definitely the brussel sprouts and fried rice + kimchee that came with the fish. The duck was underwhelming and the fish felt like it was missing something. Wish we tried the quail and rabbit rigatoni instead.,2020-02-14,4,3,5,5
39,"Food was cold, atmosphere cold, this is a hotel restaurant. We left   Mid-meal on Valentine’s Day. Ruined our evening.",2020-02-14,1,1,2,1
